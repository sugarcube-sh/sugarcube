While design tokens, CSS variables, and utility classes give you a solid foundation for your styles, they don't solve the fundamental problem of **how to organize your CSS** or write it in a maintainable, scalable way. For that, you need a methodology or architecture.

## CUBE CSS

Sugarcube recommends CUBE CSS because it harnesses the power of the cascade, integrates well with design token workflows, and naturally teaches you about CSS *as you write it*.

{/* <SiteAside type="tip">

## Adding CUBE CSS

Add CUBE CSS to your project using the `cube` command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx sugarcube cube" />

CUBE CSS is added to your project in the [styles output directory](/docs/configuration#changing-where-css-files-are-written). The command uses the `output.cube` value from your `sugarcube.config.ts` file (or falls back to `output.cssRoot`), or you can specify a custom output directory with the `--cube-dir` flag:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx sugarcube cube --cube-dir src/styles/cube" />

## File output

When you add CUBE CSS to your project, the following directory structure is created:

```
src/styles/
├── blocks/
├── compositions/
├── global/
└── utilities/
```

Sugarcube adds a starter set of files to each directory. **These are just starting points**. **CUBE CSS is a methodology, not a fixed set of files**. You can add, remove, or modify any files as needed.

See the [working with CUBE CSS](/docs/working-with-cube-css) guide for detailed patterns, examples, and how to use CUBE CSS effectively with sugarcube.

## Importing CUBE CSS

CUBE CSS files are source files that you import however your project imports styles.

```css
@import "./src/styles/global/global.css";
@import "./src/styles/compositions/flow.css";
@import "./src/styles/compositions/cluster.css";
...
```
