Starter kits are pre-built design token sets that are designed to provide a solid foundation for your project. When you run `init` without existing tokens, sugarcube installs a starter kit.

## Available Kits

### Fluid (default)

Uses [`fluidDimension`](/docs/fluid-space-and-type) tokens for spacing and typography that scale with viewport size using CSS `clamp()`.

### Static

Uses fixed dimensions (px/rem).

## Choosing a Kit

By default, `init` uses the `fluid` starter kit.

Pass the `--kit` flag to select a different starter kit:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx @sugarcube-sh/cli init --kit static" />

## Customization

Starter kits are starting points, not constraints. Edit the JSON files to build your design system.
