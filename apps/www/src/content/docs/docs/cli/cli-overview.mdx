# CLI Overview

The sugarcube CLI is a command-line tool that helps you set up and manage sugarcube projects. It handles project initialization, CSS generation, token validation, and component installation.

**Zero-config by default** - All commands support auto-discovery and sensible defaults. You can start using sugarcube with just a `*.resolver.json` file, no configuration required.

## Quick Start

**Option 1: Full setup with `init`** (recommended for new projects)
```bash
npx @sugarcube-sh/cli init
```

**Option 2: Skip `init` and go straight to generation** (if you already have a resolver)
```bash
# Just create a *.resolver.json file, then:
sugarcube generate
```

## Commands

- **`init`** - Set up a new project (optional - helps with starter kits and plugin installation)
- **`generate`** - Generate CSS variables and utility classes from your design tokens
- **`validate`** - Validate design token files for W3C compliance
- **`components`** - Install copy-to-use components for your framework
- **`cube`** - Add CUBE CSS architecture to your project

## Typical Workflow

1. **Initialize** (optional): `npx @sugarcube-sh/cli init` - Sets up starter kit, detects framework
2. **Generate** CSS: `sugarcube generate` - Processes tokens, outputs CSS
3. **Add components** as needed: `sugarcube components`
4. **Validate** tokens: `sugarcube validate`

Each command works independently with zero-config support.
