Sugarcube maintains a registry of components that you can copy into your project. They're designed to work naturally with token-driven frontends and are available as **React** and **CSS-only** components. **Web components** for framework agnosticism are a priority and soon to enter active development.

## Not a component library

Rather than shipping as packages you install, sugarcube copies components into your project as source files. Similar to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), sugarcube isn't a component library — it's how you build your component library.

## Adding components

Use the `components` command to add components to your project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="sugarcube components" />

Running without arguments prompts you to select a framework and components. 

To skip prompts, pass component names and the `--framework` flag:

<PackageManagerTabs command="sugarcube components button card --framework react" />

See [the CLI reference](/docs/reference/cli-commands) for full command options.

**Alternatively**, you can copy component code directly from the [component documentation](/docs/components). Each component page includes the full source code that you can copy and paste into your project.

## File output

When you add components, both the component implementation files and their CSS files are copied together to the same location.

For example, adding a `button` component creates:
- `src/ui/components/button/button.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/button/button.css`

### Customizing output locations

You can customize where components are installed two different ways:

1. **Using the `--components-dir` flag**:

    <PackageManagerTabs command="sugarcube components --components-dir custom-components-dir" />

2. **In your config file**:
   ```ts title="sugarcube.config.ts" ins={5} del={4}
   import { defineConfig } from "@sugarcube-sh/cli";

   export default defineConfig({
     output: {
       components: "src/components",
       cssRoot: "src/styles"
     }
   });
   ```

<SiteAside type="note">
    The `--components-dir` flag takes precedence over the config file and will update your config if the value differs.
</SiteAside>

## Components & design tokens

Components in the sugarcube registry are designed to work with design tokens. They ship with stylesheets that use CSS variables generated from your design tokens:

```css title="components/button/button.css"
.button {
    background-color: var(--color-fill-solid);
    color: var(--color-on-solid);
    ...
}
```

This means practicing [design-token-driven development](/docs/tokens#token-driven-development) becomes natural with sugarcube. To change a component's appearance, simply edit your design tokens.

<SiteAside type="caution">
    The CSS variable names that sugarcube components consume are based on tokens from sugarcube's [starter kits](/docs/starter-kits). If you're not using a starter kit, you'll need to update the component stylesheets to use your CSS variable names.
</SiteAside>

### Editing component styles

Since components are source files in your project, you can edit their CSS directly. __The stylesheets that ship with components provide a foundation to build on; you're not locked in__.

{/* ## Component dependencies

You might be wondering: if sugarcube keeps APIs minimal and avoids dependencies, how do the React components work? Complex components like dialogs and accordions need accessibility features, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

Sugarcube's React components use [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) primitives under the hood (with [Base UI](https://https://base-ui.com/) versions planned). Radix provides the accessibility and behavior layer, while sugarcube provides the styling layer that connects to your design tokens.

**The key difference:** You have the source code. When you copy a component into your project, you can see exactly how it uses Radix. You can modify it, remove the dependency if you prefer something else, or keep it as-is. The components are thin wrappers that pass through Radix's props directly — sugarcube doesn't add another layer of opinionated APIs on top.

So yes, there are dependencies and APIs, but they're transparent and under your control. You're not locked into sugarcube's choices the way you would be with a packaged component library. */}

## Next steps

Now that you understand components, you can:
- Browse [React components](/docs/components/react/accordion) and [CSS-only components](/docs/components/css-only/accordion).
- [Add CUBE CSS](/docs/cube-css) for consistent styling patterns.
