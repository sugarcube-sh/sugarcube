Sugarcube helps you build front ends on strong, reusable foundations using design tokens. This guide will get sugarcube running in your project in under a minute.

## Initialize your project

Run the `init` command in the root of an existing project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx @sugarcube-sh/cli init" />

This command will:

- detect your project structure  
- add design tokens (or use your existing ones)  
- generate CSS variables  
- install the Vite plugin if compatible  
- create a config file (if you override default settings via flags) 

<SiteAside type="note">
    The CLI will tell you whether the Vite plugin was installed. If it wasn't installed, you can skip directly to the [Without the plugin](#without-the-plugin) section.
</SiteAside>

## Configure plugin

If `init` installed the Vite plugin, you need to add it to your build configuration:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import sugarcube from "@sugarcube-sh/vite";

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [sugarcube()],
});
```

    For framework-specific examples, see the [framework guides](#framework-guides) below.
</SiteAside>

## Import generated CSS

Sugarcube generates a virtual CSS module. Import it into the entrypoint of your project:

```ts
import "virtual:sugarcube.css";
```

This single import includes both design token CSS variables and utility classes.

### Without the plugin

If you are not using the Vite plugin, sugarcube generates static CSS files instead. Import them where you import your other styles:

```css
@import "./src/styles/global/tokens.variables.gen.css";
```

That's it! You can now start building with sugarcube.

## Start building with sugarcube

- [Configure utility classes](/docs/utilities)
- [Add components from the registry](/docs/components)
- [Add CUBE CSS](/docs/cube-css)

## Customizing your setup

By default, `init` detects your project structure and makes sensible choices. You can skip plugin installation, customize directories, or choose a different starter kit. See [Advanced setup](/docs/advanced-setup) for details.
