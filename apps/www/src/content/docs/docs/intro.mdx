Sugarcube is a toolkit for building __design-token-driven front ends__. It transforms design tokens into CSS variables and just-in-time utility classes, and provides optional CSS architecture and components.

## What sugarcube provides

### Design tokens → CSS

Define your design decisions as [DTCG-format](https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/) tokens. Sugarcube generates CSS variables and (optionally) utility classes from them. Change a token value, and have your CSS update accordingly.

If you don't have tokens yet, sugarcube will add a complete [starter kit](/docs/starter-kits) during initialization.

### CSS architecture (optional)

Use the `cube` command to add [CUBE CSS](/docs/cube-css) to your project.

### Components (optional)

Add components from the [registry](/docs/components) to your project as source files.

### Integration options

Use the Vite plugin for live regeneration during development, or use the CLI to generate static CSS files you import directly (no runtime dependency).

## Use what you need

You don't have to use everything. Just want token-based CSS variables? Skip components and CUBE. Just want CUBE? Run `npx @sugarcube-sh/cli cube` to add it to your project.

## When to use sugarcube

Sugarcube is a good fit when:

- You're starting a project and want consistent front end foundations from the start
- You're building or implementing a design system or component library
- You have design tokens from Figma/Tokens Studio/etc. and want to generate CSS from them
- You're refactoring an existing front end and want to introduce structure without rewriting everything

## Get started

Run the init command in your project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="npx @sugarcube-sh/cli init" />

This detects your project settings, sets up tokens (or adds a starter kit), and generates your initial CSS.
