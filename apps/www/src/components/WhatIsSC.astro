    <p>
        Sugarcube is <strong class="text-normal">
            a toolkit for building solid front ends</strong
        >. It gives designers and developers a shared foundation they can both
        shape, while the system nudges everyone toward consistent, maintainable
        code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="text-normal"
            >There is no runtime and no required dependencies.</strong
        > Use the CLI directly, or add the Vite plugin for automatic regeneration
        during dev.
