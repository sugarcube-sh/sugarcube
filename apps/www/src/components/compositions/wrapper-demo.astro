<div class="flow flow-space-md">
    <h2>Wrapper Composition</h2>
    <p>
        The wrapper composition centers content and applies a maximum width.
        Perfect for main content areas that shouldn't stretch too wide on large
        screens.
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <h3>Centered Content</h3>
        <p>
            This content is centered and has a maximum width. It prevents text
            from becoming too wide to read comfortably on large screens while
            maintaining good readability.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wrapper composition is ideal for main content areas, articles,
            forms, and any content that benefits from controlled width and
            centering.
