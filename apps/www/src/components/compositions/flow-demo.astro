    <h2>Flow Composition</h2>
    <p>
        The flow composition creates consistent vertical spacing between
        elements. Each direct child gets the same spacing applied.
    </p>

    <div class="flow flow-space-sm">
        <h3>Small Flow</h3>
        <p>This flow uses small spacing between elements.</p>
        <p>Notice how each paragraph has consistent spacing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow flow-space-lg">
        <h3>Large Flow</h3>
        <p>This flow uses large spacing between elements.</p>
        <p>The spacing is more generous here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow flow-space-xl">
        <h3>Extra Large Flow</h3>
        <p>This flow uses extra large spacing.</p>
        <p>Maximum breathing room between elements.</p>
    </div>
